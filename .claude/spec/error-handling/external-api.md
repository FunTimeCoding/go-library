# External API error handling

Services that wrap external APIs (NetBox, Jira, Confluence, Alertmanager,
Proxmox) encounter errors that don't fit cleanly into tier 1 or tier 2.
A NetBox "name must be unique" is the caller's mistake — but we haven't
seen enough of these errors to know which are safe to exclude from Sentry.

**Default posture: capture everything to Sentry.** The 400/500 split
is for the caller. The Sentry capture is for us. These are independent
decisions. An error can be a 400 to the caller (they sent a duplicate
name) AND captured to Sentry (we want visibility into what errors our
services encounter). Only stop capturing specific errors after they've
been seen enough to be identified as noise — by adding sentinel-based
exclusions, not by skipping the tier.

**Upstream errors are always 500.** We haven't classified which
upstream errors are truly client mistakes vs infra failures vs
auth issues. Until a specific error has been observed enough to
route differently, everything from an external API is 500 with
`ErrorResponse`. The split is message quality, not status code:
parseable errors get the extracted message, opaque errors get
`constant.UnexpectedError`.

Not all upstream APIs return structured errors. Some return
opaque errors or HTML error pages. For those, the fallback
message is all we can offer.

**The captureDetail pattern:** a per-service method that checks
for the upstream's error types and extracts the best message.
Returns `*server.ErrorResponse` — always 500, always Sentry.

```go
// gonetboxd — NetBox returns GenericOpenAPIError with parseable bodies
func (s *Server) captureDetail(e error) *server.ErrorResponse {
    if m, okay := common.ExtractMessage(e); okay {
        return s.captureFail(e, m)
    }

    return s.captureFail(e, constant.UnexpectedError)
}
```

The handler returns 500 with the result:

```go
if e != nil {
    return server.Foo500JSONResponse(*s.captureDetail(e)), nil
}
```

**MCP layer equivalent:** MCP handlers use the same `captureDetail`
pattern but return `(*mcp.CallToolResult, error)` via `captureFail`
+ `response.CaptureFail`. The extraction logic is identical — only
the return type differs.

**When to add captureDetail vs just captureFail:** if the service
wraps an external API with parseable errors, use `captureDetail`
to extract the best message. If the service only has internal
stores (GORM, BoltDB, pgx), use `captureFail` with
`constant.UnexpectedError` — there's no meaningful message to
extract for the caller.

## Sentinel classification

The default posture (500, Sentry, best-effort message) applies to
errors we haven't classified yet. When a specific error has been
observed enough in Sentry to understand what it means, classify it
and route it specifically. What changes depends on what we learned:

- Status code: route to 404 (resource doesn't exist), 503
  (dependency down), or 400 (confirmed caller mistake)
- Sentry capture: skip for errors confirmed as caller noise
- Message: use the classified error's message instead of
  extraction

Classification is per-error, not per-tier. The handler checks
for the classified error before falling through to
`captureDetail`. The default remains capture-everything until
proven otherwise.

**Two shapes for classified errors:**

*Simple sentinel* — `var ErrorBrowserUnreachable = errors.New("browser unreachable")`.
Fixed message, matched with `errors.Is`. Use when the message
doesn't vary by instance — the condition is the full story.

*Typed error* — a struct carrying a formatted message, matched
with `errors.As`. Use when the message needs instance context
(which resource, which identifier). The type provides
classification, the instance carries the specifics.

```go
type NotFoundError struct {
    Message string
}

func (e *NotFoundError) Error() string { return e.Message }
func (e *NotFoundError) Is(target error) bool {
    _, ok := target.(*NotFoundError)
    return ok
}
```

The dividing line: does the message need context from the call
site? If yes, typed error. If no, simple sentinel.

**Message format:** `"subject condition: identifier"` — the what
before the which. Examples: `"machine not found: 123"`,
`"collection not found: favorites"`, `"browser unreachable"`.
The subject tells you what failed. The identifier tells you
which one. Construct the message where the knowledge is — the
function that did the lookup, not the handler that routes the
response.
