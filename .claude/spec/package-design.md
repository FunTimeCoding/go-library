# Package Design

One struct with receivers per package. This is the core rule for package
scope - it drives when to extract sub-packages and how to organize types.

## The Rule

Each package has at most one struct that carries methods (receivers). That
struct is the package's identity. Its file is named after the struct in
snake_case. Constructor lives in `new.go`.

Data-only structs (no receivers) may coexist - one per file, named after
the struct. Group related data structs in a dedicated sub-package when
there are several (e.g. `response/` for response types, `option/` for
configuration). Data-only structs with external dependencies or distinct
domain identity may also warrant their own package, even without receivers,
to keep the parent package's import graph clean and the concept
self-contained.

## Bag Packages vs Own Packages

Bag packages (`response/`, `request/`, `argument/`) hold pure data
structs — no functions, no receivers. Typically shapes from external
APIs (Habitica, Jira, Sentry, Salt, Loki, brew). The package groups
by role (what came in, what goes out), not by type.

When a type has distinct domain identity within our code — or gains
behavior (formatters, receivers, helpers) — it moves to its own
package named after the type. Examples: `response.Task` → `task.Task`,
`session.History` → `history.History`, `session.Screen` →
`screen.Screen`.

The migration is one-directional: bag → own package. Own-package
types get `New()` in `new.go` for construction and `Stub()` in
`stub.go` for zero-value error returns. Bag structs get neither.

Decision rule: **our types get own packages, their shapes stay in
bags.**

## Pointer Convention

Convert functions and domain constructors return pointers
(`*server.Tunnel`, not `server.Tunnel`). Slice returns are slices
of pointers (`[]*server.Tunnel`). This applies to:

- `convert/` functions (netbox, proxmox, habitica, atlassian)
- `New()` and `Stub()` constructors
- Source interface methods (`HabiticaSource`, `SublimeSource`, etc.)

In OpenAPI specs, optional arrays of objects use `nullable: true`
with `allOf` wrapping to generate `*[]*Type`:

```yaml
checklist:
  type: array
  items:
    nullable: true
    allOf:
    - $ref: "#/components/schemas/ChecklistItem"
```

## When to Extract

When a second struct with receivers appears in a package, extract it and
its helper functions into a sub-package. The sub-package is named after
the struct. The struct inside drops the package prefix:

```
pkg/tool/gosalt/analyzer/    → type Live struct
pkg/tool/goalertlogd/store/  → type Store struct
pkg/tool/goalertlogd/worker/ → type Worker struct
```

Not `analyzer.Analyzer` or `store.StoreStruct` - the package name
provides context.

## Interfaces

Domain-specific interfaces referencing the extracted struct's types are
defined at the consumer, not in the sub-package - unless the sub-package
owns the domain. The sub-package's mock lives in `mock_*/` next to the
real implementation.

## What Stays

Package-level functions without a receiver are fine alongside the single
struct. Constants live in `constant.go`. Each function gets its own file.

Tool entrypoint packages (`pkg/tool/go<name>/`) often have no struct with
receivers at all - just `Main()`, `run()`, and orchestration functions.
This is normal. The rule applies when structs with receivers do appear.
