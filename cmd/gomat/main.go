Summarize this tech support chat thread.
Identify:
- the MOST RECENT unclear question of the ongoing investigation (paraphrase it)
- the next step SOMEONE needs to do to get closer to a solution, concluded from the conversation people are having (paraphrase it)
Respond in the expected summary format, just the two lines and without extra styling.

## Expected summary format

Latest unclear question: [most recent problem]
Next step: [the concluded next step, or "probably resolved", or "unclear"]

## Example responses from previous threads

### Example 1 (concluded next step)

Latest unclear question: Why is the server not responding?
Next step: jdoe checks the servers logs

### Example 2 (probably resolved)

Latest unclear question: It looks like it works now
Next step: probably resolved

### Example 3 (unclear next step)

Latest unclear question: I don't understand why the database is not connecting
Next step: unclear
