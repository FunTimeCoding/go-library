## Example

### Setup

Show the current Salt states:
```sh
salt '*' state.show_highstate
salt '*' state.apply
```

List all files in the current directory (human-readable):
```sh
ls -alh
```

Here is my priority list:
* Initialize infrastructure
* Configure Salt master/minions
* Apply baseline states

### Troubleshoot

If there's a 4 AM alert for service `xyz`, restart it:
```sh
systemctl restart xyz
journalctl -u xyz -n 50
```

Check disk usage:
```sh
df -h
```

Check for high memory usage:
```sh
top
```

### Maintenance

To prepare for a maintenance window:
```sh
wall "System maintenance starting in 15 minutes. Please save your work."
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl stop postgresql
```

List all active system services:
```sh
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```

Backup application data:
```sh
tar czf /backup/app-data-$(date +%F).tar.gz /var/www /var/lib/postgresql
```
