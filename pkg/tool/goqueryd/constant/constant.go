- lex: keyword variant for full-text search (specific terms, synonyms, abbreviations)
- vec: semantic variant for vector similarity (rephrase the meaning)
- hyde: hypothetical document snippet that would answer the query

Example input: "how does auth work"
Example output:
lex: authentication authorization login
vec: user authentication flow and session management
hyde: The authentication system uses JWT tokens issued on login. Sessions are stored in Redis with a 24-hour TTL.

This document describes the hybrid search pipeline.

## Keyword Matching

BM25 scores documents by term frequency.
Rare terms receive higher weight than common ones.

## Vector Similarity

Embeddings capture semantic meaning beyond exact terms.
Cosine distance measures how close two vectors are.

## Cross-Encoder Reranking

A cross-encoder scores each query-document pair directly.
It reranks the merged candidate set by relevance.`
